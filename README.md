# About Me

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a wordsmith and aspiring web developer, navigating the realms of storytelling and technology.

## Writing Journey

In the tapestry of my education, I earned a **BA in Creative Writing and English** at Southern New Hampshire University, where I delved into the art of creative expression, literary analysis, and journalistic storytelling. Currently, I'm deepening my craft through an **MFA in Creative Writing** at SNHU.

As a writer, my work spans diverse topics, from the intricacies of the writing process to reflections on pop culture and the captivating world of horror. Influenced by literary giants like Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, and Richard Matheson, I weave narratives that captivate and resonate.

## Bridging Creativity and Technology

In addition to my literary pursuits, I'm venturing into the dynamic domain of **web development**. This journey is a natural extension of my passion for storytelling, bringing narratives to life in the digital realm.

## Professional Identity

Wearing the hats of a **writer, editor, and author**, I contribute to online publications, infusing my articles with a blend of creativity and insight. As a freelance editor, I ensure that every piece resonates with clarity and engages the audience.

Let's embark on a journey where creativity meets technology, and words shape worlds. Connect with me, and let's explore the exciting intersection of writing and web development!
