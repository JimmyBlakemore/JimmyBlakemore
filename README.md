# About Me

Hello! 👋 I'm a seasoned writer exploring the exciting realms of web development to enhance my creative toolkit.

## Writing Background

Armed with a **BA in Creative Writing and English** from Southern New Hampshire University, I'm on a perpetual journey to refine my storytelling craft. Currently pursuing an **MFA in Creative Writing**, my passion lies in weaving narratives that captivate and resonate.

## Venturing into Web Development

Eager to marry creativity with technology, I've embarked on a journey into the world of **web development**. I'm currently immersing myself in the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen eye on the React framework for dynamic front-end development.
